		 <h1>Mythology - Shiv Puran</h1>
		   <h2>The Race</h2>
			  <p>
                One day, the creator Brahma and the Preserver Vishnu had an argument over their supremacy. They were hurling abuses at each other, then started preparing for a battle. When they were about to commence, a endless, infinite pillar of light appeared before them. To end their debate, they decided that whoever could find the end of the pillar would be the superior. Shri Vishnu took the avatar of a wild boar (Varaha) and tried to find the end of the pillar, while Brahma mounted a white swan and head for the skies to find the pillar's beginning. As the pillar was infinite, finding its ends was an impossible task. Vishnu found nothing and returned, while Brahma returned with a Ketaki flower which was falling down the pillar. Brahma lied that he had found the top and produced the Ketaki flower as his witness as Vishnu accepted his supremacy. Just then, an infuriated Shiva appeared. He exposed the creator's lies by proclaiming the pillar of light as a Jyotirlinga and by telling its infiniteness. He cursed Brahma for lying, proclaiming he would <em>never</em> be worshiped on earth, which still stands today, while blessing Shri Vishnu for telling the truth, proclaiming that he would be worshipped for ages on earth with plenty of temples in his name.

                The Jyotirlingas
            </h2>
              <p>
                  According to the Shiv Puran, the places where Lord Shiva manifested himself as the pillar of light was a Jyotirlinga. At all these sites, there is a linga representing the beginningless and endless stambha, symbolising the infinite nature of Lord Shiva. There are 64 original Jyotirlingas, out of which 12 are the most sacred. A Stuthi composed by by Jagadguru Shri Adi Shankaracharya states those 12 :-
